+ The Lagrange function is used in the Lagrange multiplier method to optimize a function subject to one or more constraints.
It is defined as the sum of the objective function and the product of each Lagrange multiplier and its corresponding constraint. The Lagrange function is given by:

L(x, λ) = f(x) + Σ λᵢ gᵢ(x)

where L is the Lagrange function, x is a vector of decision variables, λ is a vector of Lagrange multipliers, f(x) is the objective function, and gᵢ(x) are the constraint functions.

+ In the Lagrange multiplier method, each constraint is represented by a Lagrange multiplier, which is a scalar variable that is introduced into the objective function.

In support vector machines (SVMs), the Lagrange multiplier is used to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes of data points. The Lagrange multiplier is introduced to the SVM objective function to enforce the constraints that the data points are correctly classified and lie on the correct side of the hyperplane.
